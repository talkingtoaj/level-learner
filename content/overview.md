# Python Regular Expressions (re) Tutorial

This tutorial will guide you through the basics of using regular expressions in Python with the 're' module. We'll cover the following levels:

1. Basic Patterns
2. Character Classes
3. Quantifiers
4. Anchors and Boundaries
5. Groups and Capturing
6. Lookahead and Lookbehind
7. Flags and Options

Each level introduces new concepts and builds upon the previous ones. Let's get started!

## Level 1: Basic Patterns

In this level, you'll learn how to match simple literal characters and use the dot (.) wildcard.

## Level 2: Character Classes

This level introduces character classes, which allow you to match specific sets of characters.

## Level 3: Quantifiers

Quantifiers let you specify how many times a pattern should occur. You'll learn about *, +, ?, and {n,m}.

## Level 4: Anchors and Boundaries

Anchors and boundaries help you match patterns at specific positions in the text, such as the start or end of a line.

## Level 5: Groups and Capturing

Groups allow you to treat multiple characters as a single unit. You'll also learn about capturing and non-capturing groups.

## Level 6: Lookahead and Lookbehind

These advanced techniques allow you to create more complex patterns by looking ahead or behind the current position.

## Level 7: Flags and Options

In this final level, you'll learn about various flags and options that modify how regular expressions behave.
